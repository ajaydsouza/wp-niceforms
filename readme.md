<a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/wp-niceforms/">WP-Niceforms</a> provides a one-click installation of Niceforms on your WordPress blog. The default theme has been optimized for usage with WordPress.

## Installation

1. Extract the entire folder wp-niceforms into your plugins director, usually '/wp-content/plugins'

2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen of WP-Admin

3. Use the class 'niceform' for the form that you would like to beautify

## Points to ponder

**Important**: In its current form, Niceforms is more than 3 years old and becoming more and more obsolete given the ever increasing browser support for CSS3 and other modern techniques. Use at your own risk!
